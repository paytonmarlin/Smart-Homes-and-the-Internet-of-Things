## The Internet of Things

As you have read in the main page, you now know that the Internet of Things (or IoT for short) is a term used to connect a multitude of devices to each other. This page will go a little bit more in depth about why the IoT is the future of technological communication between technology, and why you should keep your eyes peeled for advancements as they come out.

When you think about the advances that has been made since the pre-World War era, there has been an exponential growth of technology that has not only changed people, but the very foundation of the world that we live in. 

Take a smart watch, for example. We have technology that can be worn on your writst to measure your heart rate, oxygen intake, steps, miles you have walked, and so forth. 

**Where were we 100, or even 50 years ago?**

Take an example from the University of Texas,

>### The first â€œInternet appliance" was a Coke machine at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University in 1982. Programmers could check sensors to see how many drinks were present in the machine and if they were cold.


These 'sensors' are the very foundation of the Internet of Things. Sensors can track a variety of activities including:

- Magnetic currents
- Movement
- Vibrations
- Moisture
- Pressure
- Gas
- etc.

#### For example a sensor on a camera can detect when there is movement, turning on the recording of when someone walks infront of it. This recording can be saved in a cloud platform, letting the owners of the camera able to see all of the foot activity around the area of the camera. 

#### Or maybe when the moisture content of soil dips below a certain percentage, the sensor will relay information about the lack of water content and will automatically turn on water sprinklers.

#### How about when your windows shutters close after a certain time when the sun goes down at a certain point. This sensor will keep track of the sun's position and wil communicate with the window shutters to tell them when to close.

Thsese are just a few of the infinite possibilities that we have when allowing technology devices to communicate. I hope that these examples help illustrate what the Internet of Things can do just when you have a couple devices. All of this will lead up to a Smart Home, which will be the future of the modern homes.

As more and more technology devices come into the world, there is no doubt theat there will be limitless possibilities. 

>### ...the complexity of IoT interconnections rapidly outstrips our ability to unravel them."

The IoT can be used in almost any aspect of life. They are used to propel companies to have more accurate data. It can be used to save more money and lives in the medical field. The aspect I will focus on is how the IoT can be used to propel entertainment and can make the home a place to relax more. 

Now that you know what the IoT is, you may now ask the question of **HOW** you are able to do this. Lets go back and look at the table on the main page.

| Virtual Assistant  | Developer | IoT Compatable?  |  
|:---|:---:|---:|
| Alexa  | Amazon  | Yes  | 
| Bixby  | Samsung  | No  |  
| Cortona  | Microsoft  | Yes  |
| Google Assistant | Google | Yes |
| Siri | Apple | No |

The different virtual assitants that you see above can all (except Bixby) be programmed to 'talk' to devices. These programs are not that hard, but most devices are already prepared to talk to the virtual assistants. These devices will include:
 
 - Smart plugs
 - Smart power plugs
 - Cameras
 - Doorbell
 - Thermostats
 - Lightbulbs
 - Appliances

 All you need to do is go to the corresponding app and connect the devices. There are all walkthroughs and FAQs for any smart device that you want to program. If you want to learn more, head over to the **Smart Home** page.
